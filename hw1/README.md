# CAAP-CS: Assignment 1

## Introduction
All files included in this homework assignment were formmulated using Python 3.7. Moreover, each answer to each question is located in its
own individual, seperate python file. 

## Descriptions
* hello.py : A simple chat-bot type program which has a small conversation with you and outputs a sort of response and recolection of your answers
* Unit_Conversion.py : A simple program that converts either centimeters or inches into the desire opposite measurement
* slope.py : A program which handles a user list input and combines the amalgam of the numbers into a sum. 
* fibonacci.py : A program which utilizes the equation (golden ratio) to find the nth number of the fibonacci sequence
* CF.py: Takes one value for celsius and completes a print loop from range (0,6) and converts to Fahrenheit
* Change.py : Takes in a decimal value for change and computes how much and which coins are needed to produce the minimum result. 
## hello.py 
The user will be prompted with a series of questions and responses, such as follows: 

```
HELLO WORLD... and hello you! What is your name?: 
>>>Input for your name

Cool. Hello [NAME] nice to meet you! 

What's your favorite color?: 
>>> Input for color 
....


```

## Celsius/Fahrenheit Converter 
One will be prompted with a question such as follows:
```
What is the temperature in Fahrenheit?: 25
The temperature in Celsius is -3.888888888888889
-3.888888888888889
-3.888888888888889
-3.888888888888889
-3.888888888888889
-3.888888888888889
```
One must thus entered the desired values into the console, and the loop will go throught the print function 5 times before ending.



### Inches-Centimeter Converter 
```
The program will prompt you with the following: 

This short program is designed to convert centimeters to inches or inches to centimeters. Whilst using it, please include the necessary notation.
Enter amount with units: >>> [Numerical Measurement] [Units]
```

This will then result in the desired output. 

### Slope
This program will merely ask the user for a list of numbers seperated by a space and then calculate the summation of all those values. 
```
What is your number list?:
#example 

>>>[1 2 3 4 5]

The sum of the list is 15
```

### Change Problem
The program will prompt you with a question 
```
How much is your change?

```
You must input it in decimal format for it to work and then it will produce a list of the necessary amount of coins and which coins are needed to complete the value.
```
How much is your change?: .33
The number of coins needed to formulate this change:  5
The coins needed are (0.25, 0.05, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01)
```
