Task 1:
git add test.txt (this adds the file)
git commit -m "Updated task.txt" (this creates a commit)
Listed on commits "tested" 

Task 2: 
All directories and files are present. (you must use git add for the contents). 

Task 3: 
Listed under commit of "A few more changes."

Task 4: 
Used git.pull to get files locally 

Task 5: Commit README file

TASK 6: 

One can change the commit message by typing: git commit --amend -m "Adding Task 6" 
This amends the message from its original text, reading "Adding Task 8." 

Task 7: 
One can clone the FZF repository via: git clone https://github.com/junegunn/fzf
Shortly after one can find the "--no-mouse" commit by doing: git log > find.txt 
Opening the file in Sublime and then searching for "no--mouse" prompts the SHA (c7e86ad4f1061b0cad9f64a6c9ad26f386bc1168)
The commit essay is "Add --no-mouse option to replace FZF_MOUSE_ENABLED"

Task 8:  

I used the command "git diff" to see the difference (almost like a log of the changes before commit).

Task 9: 
The command to remove a file from the repository goes as follows: 

git rm Lab0/mistake.txt (this removes the file). 
git commit -m "Removal of mistake.txt" (this creates a commit for the removal of the file.)

Task 10: 

The process of reverting commits involves checking for the commit SHA 
This can be found by typing: git log
After finding the SHA, the process of reverting then goes as follows: 
For commit "Mistake 1 (task 10" the command is: git revert 7de150f1f004218b2d0e63e17a6f80d0e722504c
For commit "Mistake 2 (task 10)" the command is: git revert 17bda404291cb8fe9f69ad64033e6f02370a984e

Task 11: added you as collaborator
