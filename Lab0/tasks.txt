TASK 6: 

One can change the commit message by typing: git commit --amend -m "Adding Task 6" 
This amends the message from its original text, reading "Adding Task 8." 

Task 7: 
One can clone the FZF repository via: git clone https://github.com/junegunn/fzf
Shortly after one can find the "--no-mouse" commit by doing: git log > find.txt 
Opening the file in Sublime and then searching for "no--mouse" prompts the SHA (c7e86ad4f1061b0cad9f64a6c9ad26f386bc1168)
The commit essay is "Add --no-mouse option to replace FZF_MOUSE_ENABLED" 

Task 8:  

I used the command "git diff" [file] to see the difference


git rm Lab0/mistake.txt Task (9)
git commit -m "Removal of mistake.txt"
